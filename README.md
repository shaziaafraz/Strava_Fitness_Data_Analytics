📊 Strava Fitness Data Analytics Case Study
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Strava/Fitbit fitness tracker data to uncover insights into user activity, calories, sleep, and sedentary behavior. The aim is to identify health patterns and provide data-driven recommendations that wellness companies like Bellabeat/Strava can use to improve user engagement and promote healthier lifestyles.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and preprocess fitness datasets.

Perform SQL, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), and Power BI analysis.

Visualize trends in steps, calories, sleep, and sedentary time.

Derive insights and propose recommendations for better fitness habits.

🗂️ Datasets

The project uses  Strava datasets, including:

dailyActivity – Steps, calories, sedentary time.

SleepDay – Sleep duration and patterns.

HeartRate – Heart rate metrics.

HourlySteps, HourlyCalories, etc.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

SQL → Data cleaning, duplicate removal, and preprocessing.

Python → Data analysis & visualization using:

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Power BI → Interactive dashboards for storytelling.

📊 Key Visualizations (Python)

Histogram of Daily Steps → Most users fall short of 10k steps/day.

Scatterplot: Steps vs Calories → Positive correlation between activity and calorie burn.

Histogram of Sleep Duration → Many users get <7 hours of sleep.

Bar Chart: Weekday vs Weekend Sleep → Weekend “catch-up” sleep observed.

Line Plot: Hourly Activity Trends → Morning & evening peaks, sedentary afternoons.

Boxplot: Calories Burned → Wide variability, with some outliers.

Bar Chart: Sedentary Minutes → Excessive sedentary behavior across users.

Correlation Heatmap → Steps ↔ Calories strongly correlated; weak with sleep.

Bar Chart: Activity Intensity Levels → Majority activity is light intensity.

🔑 Insights

Most users do not meet daily step goals.

Calories burned increase with steps, confirming activity tracking reliability.

Users sleep less on weekdays and try to recover on weekends.

Sedentary behavior is widespread, even among active users.

✅ Recommendations

Use gamification & reminders to encourage consistent daily steps.

Promote regular sleep schedules instead of weekend catch-up sleep.

Provide personalized calorie and activity goals.

Encourage midday activity breaks to reduce sedentary time.

Introduce features highlighting activity intensity for balanced workouts.

📂 Project Deliverables
